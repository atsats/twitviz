### twitviz	

twitviz is a an exploration of Twitter accounts that use words in five categories:

1) *Foul* (a list of "foul" words typically not typically used in polite company)
2) *Legal* (a list of words used in the legal industry, e.g. "verdict")
3) *Astro* (a list of words in the astrophysics/scientific community, e.g. "asteroid")
4) *Hard* (a list of vocabulary words that are usually used by people with a higher level of education, e.g. "obstreperous")
5) *Medical* (a list of words in the medical establishment, e.g. "intravenous")

For example, do users who use foul language in tweets tend to be low-quality? Or, do users who employ a harder or specialized vocabulary in tweets tend to be of higher-quality. "Quality" here is defined as follows:

1) Verified (verified is better due to stringent criteria by Twitter)
2) Following/Follower ratio (lower is better)
3) Account Creation Date (earlier is better)
4) Profile Picture (non-default is better)
5) Favorites Count (lower is usually better)
