[["index.html", "Twitter Visualizer Chapter 1 Introduction", " Twitter Visualizer Sam Gabor, Kehao Guo 2021-04-12 Chapter 1 Introduction Twitter is an accessible online source of peoples thoughts and interactions. The question we set out to anser is the following: -Does the usage of certain tweet words indicate a typical type of Twitter user? For example, do users who use foul language in tweets tend to be low-quality? Or, do users who employ a harder or specialized vocabulary in tweets tend to be of higher-quality. Quality here is defined as follows: Verified (verified is better due to stringent criteria by Twitter) Following/Follower ratio (lower is better) Account Creation Date (earlier is better) Profile Picture (non-default is better) Favorites Count (lower is usually better) Using the above criteria, we set out to explore data from Twitter using filtered real-time streams (see: Twitter API Doc. Filtered streams allow an application developer to filter real-time tweets based on the presence of one or more selected words. To collect tweets of interest, we constructed the five word lists below: Foul (a list of foul words typically not typically used in polite company) Legal (a list of words used in the legal industry, e.g. verdict) Astro (a list of words in the astrophysics/scientific community, e.g. asteroid) Hard (a list of vocabulary words that are usually used by people with a higher level of education, e.g. obstreperous) Medical (a list of words in the medical establishment, e.g. intravenous) To collect the streamed data, a special data collector/parser program was developed in C# and .NET. This program allowed us to do the following: Collect data on each word list in threaded fashion, i.e. the data collection was run in parallel using multiple threads and multiple Twitter credentials. This was important as capturing a desired number of tweets for each word lists varied greatly in run times. Retry on the many Twitter API disconnects that are expected in the course of development. Filter out the many false positive matches delivered by the stream API (for example, on non-English tweet matches) Parse data into JSON format in preparation for importing into an R tibble. It should be noted that we initially attempted to do this data collection through two R packages (rtweet and twitteR) but these were useful for simple testing only, not larger scale data collection tasks with retries. Our program, TwitDownloader relied on a very powerful .NET library that wraps the Twitter API (see: tweetinvi and specifically: Filtered Streams) A sample output session from TwitDownloader trying to capture 5,000 tweets in each category is shown below: 3 available Twitter credentials will be cycled through. foul.txt 5000 received,784 non-match,135 non-English legal.txt 5000 received,4327 non-match,1541 non-English astro.txt 5000 received,3503 non-match,2447 non-English hard.txt 5000 received,3003 non-match,460 non-English medical.txt 5000 received,2210 non-match,360 non-English All threads exited.

Below is a raw streamed tweet as it comes from Twitter. Note that it includes both the user who tweeted and the information on the original tweet that may have been rewteeted. In addition, the information on both users (e.g. follower count, verification status, etc.) is contained in the message: The tweeting user and the user being retweeted.

In the below, fields beginning with Tweet pertain to the user who tweeted and fields beginnning with ReTweet pertain to the user being re-tweeted. Most fields are exactly as they were transmitted by Twitter, but we created a number of value added fields such as TweetUserFollowRatio which gives the ratio of TweetUserNumFollowing/TweetUserNumFollowers a measure of the importance of the user. When the number of followers is high and this ratio is much less than 1, it usually indicates a user who is a Twitter influencer. Another field of interest is TweetUserDaysOn which measures the number of days since account creation for the user; larger values indicate an account that has been around longer, a positive indicator. Similar fields exist for the ReTweet user when applicable.

The data capture took approximately 12 hours of run time, mostly due to the difficult to capture categories, such as medical. ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Category n ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 astro 12200 ## 2 foul 12200 ## 3 hard 12200 ## 4 legal 12200 ## 5 medical 12064 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Upon checking the number of missing values in each column in the parsed data frame, we found that most missing values occur to either irrelevant attributes of the tweets (such as coordinate data) or those information about retweets and the corresponding users (such as ReTweetUserScreenName). ## Category NumMatchWords ## 0 0 ## MatchWords TweetUserScreenName ## 0 0 ## TweetUserDaysOn TweetUserNumFollowers ## 0 0 ## TweetUserNumFollowing TweetUserFollowRatio ## 0 609 ## TweetUserNumTweets TweetUserNumFavorites ## 0 0 ## TweetUserVerified TweetUserProtected ## 0 0 ## TweetUserDefaultProfilePic TweetNumQuoted ## 0 0 ## TweetNumReplied TweetNumFavorite ## 0 0 ## TweetNumRetweet IsRetweet ## 0 0 ## NumMedia NumUrls ## 0 0 ## NumHashtags NumContributors ## 0 60864 ## NumUserMentions NumSymbols ## 0 0 ## PossiblySensitive Source ## 0 0 ## SourceUrl Place ## 57050 60311 ## Longitude Latitude ## 60756 60756 ## TweetId TweetCreatedAt ## 0 0 ## ReTweetUserScreenName ReTweetUserDaysOn ## 28296 28296 ## ReTweetUserNumFollowers ReTweetUserNumFollowing ## 28296 28296 ## ReTweetUserFollowRatio ReTweetUserNumTweets ## 28346 28296 ## ReTweetUserNumFavorites ReTweetNumQuoted ## 28296 28296 ## ReTweetNumReplied ReTweetNumFavorite ## 28296 28296 ## ReTweetNumRetweet ReTweetUserVerified ## 28296 28296 ## ReTweetUserProtected ReTweetUserDefaultProfilePic ## 28296 28296 ## Lang TweetText ## 0 0 ## ReTweetText ## 28296 The only attribute with missing values of concern is TweetUserFollowRatio, which is the ratio of the following count to the follower of a Twitter user. After exploring the data, we discovered that the entries with missing TweetUserFollowRatio match exactly with those with 0 followers count and non-verified status. Since it makes sense that an user with no follower is not verified, it is safe to conclude that the 0 values in TweetUserNumFollowers are the direct cause of the missing values. Since the 0 value for followers count would lead to a following/followers ratio of positive infinity, we simply drop the entries with 0 TweetUserNumFollowers. Looking into the distribution of user with no follower over each category, we found no clear relationship of whether having no follower indicates quality of an user. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results We will focus on visualizing the criteria that determine the quality of an user: TweetUserDefaultProfilePic: whether an user account uses default Twitter profile picture. TweetUserFollowRatio: the ratio of the following count to the followers count of an user account. TweetUserVerified: whether an user account is independently authenticated by the platform and is considered influential. TweetUserNumFavorites: the number of favorites an user account has received. TweetUserDaysOn: the number of days since an user accounts creation. Category: the category of the word list that the tweet posted by an particular user fell into. First of all, all twitter users of the collected tweets use non-default profile picture for Twitter as shown by the following pie chart. Therefore, TweetUserDefaultProfilePic would not be a meaningful metrics to determine quality of an user for this particular sample data. It is also observed that duplicates exists in our collected sample. After dropping out entries with missing values of concern, we found that 3718 users posted multiple tweets and that 986 users posted tweets that fell into multiple categories of word lists. The following bar chart shows the distribution of tweets posted by users who posted multiple tweets. It can be observed that the number of tweets that falls into professional categories (legal, medical, legal) is significantly more than that of the other two categories. For avoiding future confusion, we drop the extraneous entries of any user, allowing only one tweet of a single category per user. Then, we use a parallel coordinate plot shown below to explore user characteristics from the given variables, highlighting those who used foul words in their tweets. It can be seen that the difference is not significantly large except for the verified status. Very few of users who used foul words is verified whereas at least a portion of users who didnt use foul words is verified. The above find may suggest that verified status is a good indicator of the quality of an user. Thus, we went further to explore the distribution of categories of tweets posted by verified and non-verified users by using a faceted bar chart. It is evident that the percentage of non-verified users who tweeted foul words is higher than the percentage of those who did not. In fact, the foul category has the smallest percentage among verified users. This may suggest that influential users with a larger potential audience are more cautious with choices of words and are thus considered as high quality. In additional, we are interested in seeing whether features that implies popularity of an user on Twitter can define user quality. After eliminating outliers, we made boxplots of TweetUserNumFavorites and TweetUserFollowRatio over each category to visualize the distribution of data for each property. In both plots, categories are sorted in descending order by the median values. It can be observed that users who used foul words may have the lowest following/follower ratio and the second highest favorites count. However, such a claim is not well supported by the data as it can be seen that statistics for all five categories are close to each other and are not significantly different. Similar conclusion can be drawn from the below scatter plot showing relationship between TweetUserFollowRatio and TweetUserNumFavorites. Density of users who tweeted foul words seems to be higher on the lower end of values of TweetUserFollowRatio, weakly indicating higher popularity of those users. Finally, we look into distribution of TweetUserDaysOn over each category via a mosaic plot. After encoding the account length into different ranges, we can clearly see that the proportion of users who tweeted foul words decreases as the account length increases. This may indicate that users who are more experienced with using Twitter tend to be those of higher quality.

For example, do the users who were classified in the foul category tend to always use such words in all their tweets? Sentiment analysis of collected tweets to more properly gauge context. Another direction worth exploring is the quality of users and user interactions around specific historical events, such as the Jan 6, 2021 Insurrection. This type of analysis is more difficult to conduct, however, as Twitter significantly limits historical access. "]]
