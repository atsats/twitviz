[["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation To aid in the exploratory process, our parser produces the below format for each matching streamed record received. In the below, fields beginning with Tweet pertain to the user who tweeted and fields beginnning with ReTweet pertain to the user being re-tweeted. Most fields are exactly as they were transmitted by Twitter, but we created a number of value added fields such as TweetUserFollowRatio which gives the ratio of TweetUserNumFollowing/TweetUserNumFollowers a measure of the importance of the user. When the number of followers is high and this ratio is much less than 1, it usually indicates a user who is a Twitter influencer. Another field of interest is TweetUserDaysOn which measures the number of days since account creation for the user; larger values indicate an account that has been around longer, a positive indicator. Similar fields exist for the ReTweet user when applicable.
